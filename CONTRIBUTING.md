## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please search for existing Issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

Some tips for a great report are: clear and descriptive title, describing steps to reproduce de problem, which platform/environment and version the issue happens, include logs and screenshots.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue or a Pull Request that seems related to the same thing that you're experiencing, please include their links to your report.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Suggestions are always welcomed, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

Please search for existing Issues as you might find out that a similar enhancement suggestion might have been submitted previously. Upvoting, commenting and collaborating to an existing suggestion is preferred to creating new ones, as it's easier to collaborate and measure engagement for similar requests in a single Issue.

When creating an enhancement suggestion issue, make it as detailed as possible. Describe what the enhancement goal is, which common areas it affects, give some usage examples, even code snippets are welcome!

### Pull Requests

Code changes to the repositories must ensure they fix problems that are important to the community and enhance the project's quality and maintainability.

Pull Requests must be as detailed as possible, including examples of what it's trying to fix/improve, considering backwards compatibility and how the change will affect current users.

All check status for linting, automated tests, coverage and others must pass before the Pull Request is eligible for review. Reviewers may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be accepted.
