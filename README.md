# ImmutableX Core SDK Swift

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a7887f9758562e49b171/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/62be55bacb1f54014d00579d/maintainability) [![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a7887f9758562e49b171/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/62be55bacb1f54014d00579d/test_coverage)

The ImmutableX Core SDK Swift provides convenient access to the Immutable API's for applications written on the ImmutableX platform.

## Documentation

See the [developer guides](https://docs.x.immutable.com) for information on building on ImmutableX.

See the [API reference documentation](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference) for more information on our API's.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- iOS 13.0 or macOS 10.15
- Swift 5.7

### Swift Package Manager

In your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-swift.git", from: "1.0.0-beta.1")
]
```

### Cocoapods

In your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'ImmutableXCore'
end
```

## Usage

### Initialisation

The Core SDK must be initialised before any of its classes are used. Upon initialisation the base environment and log level may be defined. Once initialised a shared instace will be available for accessing the [Workflow Functions](#workflow-functions).

For example, you initialise the SDK and retrieve a URL to buy crypto through Moonpay:

```swift
ImmutableX.initialize(base: .sandbox)

let url = try await ImmutableX.shared.buyCryptoURL(signer: signer)
```

### Workflow Functions

Utility functions accessed via `ImmutableX.shared` that will chain necessary API calls to complete a process or perform a transaction.

- Register a user with ImmutableX
- Buy cryptocurrency via Moonpay
- Buy ERC721
- Sell ERC721
- Cancel order
- Transfer ERC20/ERC721/ETH

### Standard API Requests

The Core SDK includes classes that interact with the ImmutableX APIs.

e.g. Get a list of collections ordered by name in ascending order

```swift
let collections = try await CollectionsAPI.listCollections(
    pageSize: 20,
    orderBy: .name,
    direction: "asc"
)
```

View the [OpenAPI spec](openapi.json) for a full list of API requests available in the Core SDK.

### Wallet Connection

In order to use any workflow functions, you will need to pass in the connected wallet provider. This means you will need to implement your own Wallet L1 [Signer](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-swift/blob/main/Sources/ImmutableXCore/Signer.swift) and L2 [StarkSigner](https://github.com/immutable/imx-core-sdk-swift/blob/main/Sources/ImmutableXCore/Signer.swift).

Once you have a `Signer` instance you can generate the user's Stark key pair and use the result to instantiate a `StarkSigner`, for example, by using the default `StandardStarkSigner` provided by the SDK.

```swift
let keyPair = try await StarkKey.generateKeyPair(from: signer)
let starkSigner = StandardStarkSigner(pair: keyPair)
```

## Autogenerated Code

Parts of the Core SDK are automagically generated.

### API Autogenerated Code

We use OpenAPI (formally known as Swagger) to auto-generate the API clients that connect to the public APIs.

The OpenAPI spec is retrieved from https://api.x.immutable.com/openapi and also saved in the repo [here](openapi.json).

Upon updating the `openapi.json` file, ensure [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) is installed, then run `./generateapi.sh` to regenerate the files. Any custom templates should be appropriately modified or removed as needed. These can be found in the `.openapi-generator/templates` directory.

## Changelog Management

The following headings should be used as appropriate

- Added
- Changed
- Deprecated
- Removed
- Fixed

What follows is an example with all the change headings, for real world use only use headings when appropriate.

This goes at the top of the `CHANGELOG.md` above the most recent release:

```markdown
